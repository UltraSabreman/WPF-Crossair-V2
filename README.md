Crosshair Loader V2
===============

This is version 2 of my crosshair loader. It comes pre-set with a basic crosshair and preconfigured to work with planetside 2.

*Note*: This project is currently undergoing a re-write;

TODO:
-----
 + Move All reticule logic to model
 + Convert options to WPF
 + Convert bind button to WPF control.
 + Add a (wpf?) tray icon
 + Add Detailed logging
 + Add comprehensive error handling.
 + Make it less shit

Features
-------
 + Uses .png files for the overlay, allowing full transparency (and therefore pretty crosshairs)
 + Much more stable than the previous version
 + Fully configurable
 + Can be overplayed over *ANY* window of your choosing.
<code>Note: because of the way this works, the thing you're overlaying *HAS* to be in a window  </code>
<code>In other words: no full screen games (you can have fake full screen though)</code>

Installation
-------
 1) Extract the release to a folder of your choosing
 
 2) Run the exe 
 
 3) Configure it to work with a program of your choosing (right click on tray icon and click Options).
 
Disclaimer
----
 Because of the way this works, this *WILL NOT* get you banned from any game (it's simply overlaying a transparent window over a window of your choosing, which is equivelent to tapigng a dot to your screen). In fact, the only way that you could possibly get banned is if the developers decided to look for this things process name directly (which will never happen).
 
 HOWEVER, in the event that something crazy does happen, by downloading this you agree that it's not my (or my programs) fault and assume all responsibility.
